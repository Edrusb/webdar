Backup and restore data as a lazy "cloud" user

       ---

Webdar has been designed taking first into account the restoration step.
For that reason:
 - it uses no complex graphical user interface but rather a Web interface,
   which can be used remotely as well as from the host where webdar is running.
 - It is available as a single binary file with a statically linked
   version, suitable to take place beside backups or on a live CD/DVD,
 - it does not require any database to setup,
 - can be available as a single binary file (statically linked binary)
 - relies on a proven robust, portable, full featured backup/restoration
   software: libdar
 - can receive libdar configuration and user definitions through the HTTP
   session (uploading configuration to webdar)
 - is simple to use, compatible with any browser respecting the HTTP
   standard,
 - does not make use of web scripting to reduce the surface of attack,
 - is expected to be self-explanatory and intuitive (OK, this is subjective!)
 - Webdar is not a commercial tool and will never become one I hope, it
   is licensed under GPLv3: this is a pure good and robust free software.
