Backup and restore data as a lazy "cloud" user

       ---

Webdar has been designed taking first into account the restoration step.
For that reason:
 - it uses no complex graphical user interface but rather a Web interface,
   which can be used usable remotely from the host where webdar is running
   or from a live CD/DVD/USB key for example.
 - it uses no complex database
 - can be available as a single binary file (statically linked binary)
 - relies on a proven robust, portable, full featured backup/restoration
   software: libdar
 - it is simple to use, compatible with any browser respecting the HTTP
   standard,
 - does not make use of web scripting that are an important source of
   security breach today,
 - is expected to be self-explanatory and intuitive,
 - webdar is not commercial and will never become, it is licensed under
   GPLv3: this is free software.
