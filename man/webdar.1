.SH DESCRIPTION
.B webdar
is a web server providing a way to manipulate dar archive from a remote host over the network thanks to a classical web browser. Over managing dar archive it also provides the ability to interface with a remote FTP server where to store or fetch dar archive slices.
.P
You can find more help information using a web browser pointing it on the interface and port you specified using -l option of webdar.
.P
Note that by default webdar is not a daemon, it uses stderr/stdout to report error messages.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 20
-l, --listen <network interface>[:port] [, ...]
.RS
This option defines on which port(s) and interface(s) to listen for incoming requests. Network interface can be a hostname, FQDN, IPv4 or IPv6 address. IPv6 address have to be surrounded by squared brackets (`[' and `]'). Note that you will need to quote the argument when using IPv6 address format for the square brackets not to be interpreted by the shell. If an interface is specified without port, it defaults to port 8008.
.P
Example : -l "1.2.3.4,[::1]:8082,127.0.0.1:8083"
.P
In the previous example, webdar will listen on the interface having the IP address '1.2.3.4' on port 8008, on IPv6 address ::1 port 8082 and IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 on port 8083.
.P
Without -l option, webdar listens on loopback interface (127.0.0.1) on port 8008
