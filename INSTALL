INSTALLATION

extract source package and run

    ./configure

to install webdar type (as root):

   make install

Note: if upx is available and detected in the system at the time ./configure
is run, replace 'make install' by 'make install-strip' for the installed binary
to be the smallest possible (upx compressed without the symbol table)


It will be installed under /usr/local
you can specify another place using the the PREFIX
variable:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

Last if you want to build a package for a distro, you can use
the DESTDIR variable in addition, and no more require root
priviledge:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp install

If you want to uninstall webdar you can use the
'uninstall' target,  DESTDIR and/or --prefix should
be the same as the one used at installation step:

   make uninstall

or for example:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp uninstall


What's next? Read the man page:

       man webdar

or simpler, just run webdar and follow the displayed instructions
