INSTALLATION

extract source package and run

    ./configure

to install webdar type (as root):

   make install

(or make install-strip for a smaller binary)

It will be installed under /usr/local
you can specify another place using the the PREFIX
variable:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

Last if you want to build a distro package, you can use
the DESTDIR variable in addition, and no more need root
priviledge:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp install

If you want to uninstall webdar you can use the
'uninstall' target,  DESTDIR and/or --prefix should
be the same as the one used at installation step:

or

   make DESTDIR=/tmp --prefix=/usr uninstall
