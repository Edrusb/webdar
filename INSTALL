Currently, webdar is still a work in progress,

REQUIREMENTS

you need having libdar from current development (future dar release 2.5.0)
compiled and installed with "--enable-mode=64 --prefix=/usr" passed to
dar's ./configure. You can also have installed it under /usr/local in place
of /usr, in that case you need to edit the Makefile and add:

-I/usr/local/include/dar to CXXFLAGS
and -L/usr/local/lib to LDFLAGS

INSTALLATION

you can compile webdar by issuing 'make':

    make

to install webdar type (as root):

   make install

(or make install-strip for a smaller binary)

It will be installed under /usr/local
you can specify another place using the the PREFIX
variable:

   make PREFIX=/usr install

Last if you want to build a package you can use
the DESTDIR variable in addition, and no more need root
priviledge:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp PREFIX=/usr install

If you want to uninstall webdar you can use the
'uninstall' target, with or without DESTDIR and PREFIX:

   make uninstall
   make DESTDIR=/tmp uninstall
   make DESTDIR=/tmp PREFIX=/usr uninstall
