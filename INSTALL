(*) Webdar works with libthreadar >= 1.5.2 but with some
standard libraries like musl, it needs 1.6.0 or more recent
to setup stack thread size to larger value than the default
this library uses.

(**)
Supported browsers:
- Firefox has been tested on Linux, Windows and Android
- Google Chrome is known to work on MS Windows
- MS Edge is known to work on MS Windows
Unsupported browsers:
- lynx is known *not* to work and is unsupported
- w3m is know *not* to work and is unsupported
Other browsers supporting HTTP 1.1 should work


INSTALLATION

extract source package and run

    ./configure

to install webdar type (as root):

   make install

Note: if upx is available and detected in the system at the time ./configure
is run, replace 'make install' by 'make install-strip' for the installed binary
to be the smallest possible (upx compressed without the symbol table)


It will be installed under /usr/local
you can specify another place using the the PREFIX
variable:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

Last if you want to build a package for a distro, you can use
the DESTDIR variable in addition, and no more require root
priviledge:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp install

If you want to uninstall webdar you can use the
'uninstall' target,  DESTDIR and/or --prefix should
be the same as the one used at installation step:

   make uninstall

or for example:

   make DESTDIR=/tmp uninstall


What's next? Read the man page:

       man webdar

or simpler, just run webdar and follow the displayed instructions
