doc/webdar.txt which describes expected features for webdar


NOTE ABOUT RELEASE 0.0.1:
only a few set of feature are implemented, you can do all operation you are
used to do with dar, kdar, darGUI or other software manipulating dar archives
but with webdar release 0.0.1 you cannot filter files, nor define an
overwriting policy. See the TODO file for the feature that will be implemented
for release 1.0.0 and next releases.
